            Bozoma "Boz" Saint John is the Chief Marketing Officer at Netflix.
            She was named among Top 50 Most Influential Female Leaders in Africa
            within corporate and business sphere by Leading Ladies Africa, which
            credits her for being one of their top female leaders to look up

            Saint John is well-known for her philanthropic efforts, which
            include serving on the boards of Girls Who Code and Vital Voices.
            She also represents
            <a href="https://pencilsofpromise.org/"> Pencils of Promise</a> as a
            Global Ambassador to Ghana; this work earned her placement in
            President Obama's Advisory Council! And let me tell you something
            else - she graduated from Wesleyan University with honors (and went
            there too)! Other than being involved within various communities
            through business or community service organizations like Black
            advisory board member at Impact Initiative by CFDA), I'm not sure
            what more could be said about Saint John that hasn
